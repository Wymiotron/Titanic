#Titanic - Random Forrest Algorithms vs Deep Learning
Project checking which model of supervised machine learning works better on classic
dataset - Titanic. The Deep Learning model with several hyperparameters and the random forest model were tested.

##Technologies used in the project
Basic phyton language libraries. The model was made with the RandomForrest and Deep Learning technique. Python version 3.10.9

##Conclusions
The dataset from the www.Kaggle.com portal used in the task shows that the random forest model worked better in this case
(77% correct prediction) than deep learning (76%). The model was adjusted accordingly. Thanks to the reinforcement of GridSearchCV
a 2% better result was obtained. Feature importance has been visualized and included in the table. They can be a bit surprising.

This short project was ranked in the top 20% of the best results in the "Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster" contest on www.Kaggle.com.
